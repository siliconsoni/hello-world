I'm learning to use git so I can keep my things organised while learning to code.

Do I really need to learn to code? Maybe not. But it's useful. It doesn't take too long and it puts me in a very different league altogether. Or at least that's why I seem to think. 

Coders, on the other hand, think that being on the business side is more beneficial. Biz dev and sales are looked on as afvourable jobs to be in. Because they seem to be making more money and having a bigger impact.

Impact. Is all that matters in the end.

And if my route is optimising for impact, then I need to be firmly on the business side. But be the most technically savvy person on the business side - to the point that I can run tech businesses. Make traditional businesses into tech businesses. That's what I need to do.

So how does FLuidMap fit into all this? There's no traditional business that's being disrupted. There's no system to make more efficient. There are processes to make more efficient, but not systems. And I work best on the system scale.

Think of data science as a system. Think of IT as a system. Plug into their systems.

Hmm. This is tough.
